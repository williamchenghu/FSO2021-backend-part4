# FullStackOpen2021-backend

Backend exercises (part4) of Full Stack Open 2021.

This repo is used for excercises handing-in.

## Exercises 4.1.-4.2.

In the exercises for this part we will be building a _blog list_ application, that allows users to save information about interesting blogs they have stumbled across on the internet. For each listed blog we will save the author, title, url, and amount of upvotes from users of the application.

### Step 1

Base on the code given [HERE](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4/structure_of_backend_application_introduction_to_testing#exercises-4-1-4-2)

Turn the application into a functioning _npm_ project. In order to keep your development productive, configure the application to be executed with _nodemon_. You can create a new database for your application with MongoDB Atlas, or use the same database from the previous part's exercises.

Verify that it is possible to add blogs to list with Postman or the VS Code REST client and that the application returns the added blogs at the correct endpoint.
